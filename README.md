## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to use the picture and hgroup HTML elements. I also used mobile first using media query for the first time. I set up the mobile version first, then tweaked for desktop, then had to go back and tweak some mobile CSS again.

### Continued development

I feel like the code is a mess, but I was happy with my overall "approach" to the project, breaking down the html classes in a separate doc to make sure I was clear on them all before beginning the CSS. I still think I have a lot to learn as far as HTML & CSS go - especially with the bigger picture concerns like how to think forward for extensibility - but I really haven't learned much about these ideas yet. I'm about 2 weeks into my front end dev learning process. I'm at the beginning, so there's a lot more to learn.

### Useful resources & Acknowledgments

- [How to plan your HTML (1): Product Preview Card](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/html-plan-product-preview/#product-image) - This helped me structure the divs and learn the bigger picture approach to a project. Also great tips on using the <picture> element and <hgroup> element. I learned a lot!
- A friend of mine also helped me troubleshoot sizing for the 2 halves of the desktop version. (Varin)
